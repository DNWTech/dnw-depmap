DNW-depmap
=============

DNW-depmap is an Eclipse plug-in to help create Java code dependency map. Our goal is to help developer easily identify the areas of influence when they change code.

Development Environment
-----------------------
- JDK 1.7 (Neo4j graph database need)
- Eclipse 3.7 (indigo)
  - import [codetemplates.xml](https://github.com/manbaum/dnw-depmap/blob/develop/codetemplates.xml) into ```Preferences|Java|Code Style|Code Templates```
  - import [codestyle.xml](https://github.com/manbaum/dnw-depmap/blob/develop/codestyle.xml) into ```Preferences|Java|Code Style|Formatter```
- Format code before commit

Getting Start
-------------
1. Download Neo4j 2.1.5 from [www.neo4j.com](http://neo4j.com/download/).
2. Follows [the instruction](http://neo4j.com/docs/2.1.5/deployment.html) to install and deploy Neo4j server.
3. Check out the project into Eclipse.
4. Configure ```DBPATH``` in ```Activator.java``` to the database store directory of your installation of Neo4j server.
4. Compile and Run the project as a Eclipse Application.
5. In running workspace, import a Java project.
6. Compile the Java project to make sure no syntax error in it.
7. Select any Java element (Java file, or package, or even the whole Java Project) and click the mouse right key, from the pop-up context menu select "Analysis Dependency".
8. Wait for done.
9. Close the running Eclipse Application.
10. Startup the Neo4j server, and open a browser, writing Cypher query to manipulate the data generated by this program.
11. 

Data Model
----------
- ```Class``` - as a node, labeled with ```'Type'``` and ```'Class'```.
 - property ```name```: the full qualified class name with all type parameters replaced with ```'?'```. e.g. ```'java.util.ArrayList<?>'```.
 - property ```displayname```: the bare name (no package name) of the class with type parameters. e.g. ```'ArrayList<Object>'```.
 - property ```parent```: the full qualified class name of it's superclass. e.g. ```'java.lang.Object'```. 
 - property ```impls```: an array contains names of interfaces which implements. e.g. ```['java.util.List<?>']```. 
- ```Interface``` - as a node, labeled with ```'Type'``` and ```'Interface'```.
 - property ```name```: the full qualified class name with all type parameters replaced with ```'?'```. e.g. ```'java.util.List<?>'```.
 - property ```displayname```: the bare name (no package name) of the class with type parameters. e.g. ```'List<Object>'```. 
 - property ```parent```: an array contains names of interfaces which extends. e.g. ```['java.util.Collection<?>']```.
