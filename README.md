DNW-depmap
=============

DNW-depmap is a Eclipse plug-in to help create Java code dependency map. Our goal is to help developer easily identify the areas of influence when they change code.

Code Template & Code Style
--------------------------
Import [codetemplates.xml](https://github.com/manbaum/dnw-depmap/blob/develop/codetemplates.xml) into your Eclipse IDE (3.7 indigo), to follow the project. We use Eclipse default code style to format code.
